*The only stake requirement to run one of the 50 nodes on mainnet is you must be in the top 50 nodes stake wise*.

## What will block rewards and network fees look like on Enigma?

Currently network rewards on the Enigma mainnet are split as follows, 25% goes to Validators and 75% goes into the community pool to fund community projects.

As of 4/6/2020 slashing parameters are

## What are hardware and software requirements?

Specialized hardware requirements for mainnet are not substantial. However, running a secret node will require access to an SGX-enabled computer or an SGX-enabled cloud operator. Any 6th Generation Intel Processor (Skylake) after Q3 of 2015 should have this capability. However, this may or may not be enabled by the BIOS â€” for example, SGX in Mac computers is not and cannot be enabled. Currently IBM and Alibaba Cloud do enable SGX instances. For a detailed list of SGX enabled hardware and cloud options, please visit this [link](https://github.com/ayeks/SGX-hardware). Additionally, enigma will require the use of Linux as an operating system as Windows is not expected to be supported in Discovery.
