    "description": "Update community fee\n\n This change is needed for community spend based proposals to be successfully funded.\n\n This proposal will change the current community tax from 2% to 75%.\n\n Once the community pool has enough funding to complete several existing/upcoming community spend based proposals, we will propose new fee/inflation settings for the Enigma Mainnet.\n\n Note:  While secretnodes.org will listen to feedback from all parties, understand that we are not a proxy for the team, community, or other validators, we will exclusively cast our vote for terms around fees/inflation that we believe best for the health of the network.",
