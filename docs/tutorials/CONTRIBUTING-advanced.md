## Clone the repo

Check out the code and go into the docs directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/secretnodes/learn.git
cd docs
```

## Initialize

## Writing Tutorials

To edit or add tutorials, cd into the tutorials folder and either edit or create new tutorials in markdown.

```

Then preview the changes on your local machine by doing the following.

```bash
cd ./learn
```
Then serve the site on your local machine.
