```

## Clone the repo

Check out the code and go into the docs directory:

## Tips for contributing

1. Make sure all new features are tested and the tests pass.
2. Bug fixes must include a description demonstrating the error that it fixes.
3. Open an issue first and seek advice for your change before submitting
   a pull request. Large features which have never been discussed are
   unlikely to be accepted. *You have been warned.*

## Writing Tutorials

To add tutorials cd into the tutorials folder and either edit or create new tutorials in markdown.

```bash
cd ./docs/tutorials
```
