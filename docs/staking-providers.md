# Staking

The secretnodes.org community pool is administered by [OmniStake](https://t.me/omnistake) which is run by the co-founders of secretnodes.org. We have privately raised a modest amount of funding to build a staking pool for a small handful of proof-of-stake networks, at this stage we are largly focused on enigma. OmniStake is committed to putting resources into the org on an ongoing basis.
