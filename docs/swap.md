## Unify The Enigma Community Part 1

On Feb 17th 2020 Secretnodes.org submitted [Proposal #2](https://explorer.scrt.cashmaney.com/proposals/2), stating, “I propose we collectively find a way to achieve a token swap so we can unify the Enigma Community. We already have a diverse set of people ready to build on enigma, participate in governance, stake, and run nodes from all around the world. I welcome everyone interested in this to further discuss how it can be achieved here.”

The initial proposal served as a signal to solicit community feedback regarding a token swap, and was posted to Secretnodes.org’s GitHub to solicit comments on [This github issue](https://github.com/secretnodes/secretnodes.org/issues/13)

As can be seen in the comment thread there is overwhelming support by the community for a 1:1 ENG to SCRT burn to mint ratio. The scope of [Proposal #4](https://explorer.scrt.cashmaney.com/proposals/4), the followup proposal to [Proposal #2](https://explorer.scrt.cashmaney.com/proposals/2), is not to get into arguments regarding token supply, or details surrounding future supply (i.e. inflation). Secretnodes.org believes decisions regarding future token supply are best left to later proposals when the network has more stability and active participation in governance. Furthermore, given the time sensitive nature of executing Burn ENG for SCRT! for the health of the network and community it’s best not to make the proposal terms herein any more complicated than they already are.

## Burn ENG for SCRT!

On March 7th 2020 Secretnodes org put out a high level plan for ["Burn ENG for SCRT!"](https://explorer.scrt.cashmaney.com/proposals/4) SCRT (“Secret”) is used for staking, governance, and transaction fees within the Enigma network which is now LIVE based on Cosmos SDK/Tendermint. It is critical to the future of the Enigma protocol that the broader community that currently holds ENG tokens to be able to burn their tokens in exchange for SCRT being minted to participate in staking, governance, and transaction fees. This proposal outlines a brief background, technical approach, and detailed milestones to achieving an expeditious, straightforward and secure Burn ENG for SCRT!

## Block Reward Adjustment

[Proposal 5](https://explorer.scrt.cashmaney.com/proposals/5) was a proposed change to block rewards. With this change the Community Pool recives 75% of the block rewards and the Validators recieve 25%. The initial parameters had the Community Pool set to get 2% of block rewards with Validators getting 98%. This change was ultimately needed to successfully fund [Proposal #4](https://explorer.scrt.cashmaney.com/proposals/4). In [Proposal 5](https://explorer.scrt.cashmaney.com/proposals/5) we say "Once the community pool has enough funding to complete several existing/upcoming community spend based proposals, we will propose new fee/inflation settings for the Enigma Mainnet." but ultimately we take the position that any changes to this are likely better made after the token swap.

## Burn ENG for SCRT! Allocation Multisig

> In draft from 4/16/2020 untill 4/21/2020

This proposal is merely intended to solve the issue of how to efficiently pay out the parties doing work for the approved proposal 4.

In proposal 4 the initial budget was 422k SCRT. Through a draft period we opted to remove a proposed 2% minting fee. In this final budget we are keeping everything the same other than increasing the audit budget in order to make sure we cover the full costs of the audit.

Due to the risks of not knowing what SCRT will be worth when it goes to reimburse those who pay for the audit, not knowing when SCRT will be liquid / listed, and the need for audit costs to be covered up front we have determined the final amount we need allocated for audit is 163k SCRT and the total allocation for Burn ENG for SCRT! is 285k SCRT.

Timeline

With this allocation we are ready to commit to starting the Burn ENG for SCRT process by the end of May 2020. With the progress we have made so far the only things left is to reach code completion, test everything works, audit the code, then deploy.

## Swap FAQ

## When is the Token Swap?

There is not a specific date yet for the token swap but the process is moving forward. As of 4/6/2020 the most up to date information on the swap plans can be found [here](https://explorer.scrt.cashmaney.com/proposals/4). More updates will come in the month of April 2020.

## Can I swap my tokens even if I didn't participate in the ICO?

You can swap any tokens that you have control over. It does not matter if you participated in the ICO.

## Why will the Token Swap only be open for a limited window?

The token swap requires ongoing efforts / coordination to ensure it runs smoothly. For this reason it doesn't seem reasonble to expect it to continue forever, everyone is committed to running the swap for a reasonable amount of time so everyone is assured to get a minimum of 90 days to swap once the process officially starts.

## What happens to my burned ENG?

The ENG is provably sent to an address no one has control over by the end user or participating exchange. More details on the specifics will released as the process continues. A 3rd party overview on industry best practices can be found [here](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/token-burning-explained).

## Can I convert my SCRT back to ENG if I change my mind?

No. This was designed to be a one way process and as such cannot be reversed.

## What will happen to the ENG token?

The only use of the ENG token going forward is through the Burn ENG for SCRT! There is no other use for ENG now and there will not be utility added in the future. [The Enigma team has stated they are committed to developing the enigma protocol powered by SCRT](https://blog.enigma.co/the-enigma-mainnet-has-launched-3bd0d40fe80d).

## Will exchanges automatically swap my ENG for SCRT?

secretnodes.org cannot make promises on behalf of any exchanges in regards to what they will do.

## Will there be a user interface that I can use to swap my tokens?

Yes.
