# Burn ENG for SCRT! FAQ

## When is the Token Swap?

There is not a specific date yet for the token swap but the process is moving forward. As of 4/6/2020 the most up to date information on the swap plans can be found [here](https://explorer.scrt.cashmaney.com/proposals/4). More updates will come in the month of April 2020.

## Why will the Token Swap only be open for a limited window?

The token swap requires ongoing efforts / coordination to ensure it runs smoothly. For this reason it doesn't seem reasonble to expect it to continue forever, everyone is committed to running the swap for a reasonable amount of time so everyone is assured to get a minimum of 90 days to swap once the process officially starts.
