## Unify The Enigma Community Part 1

On Feb 17th 2020 Secretnodes.org submitted [Proposal #2](https://explorer.scrt.cashmaney.com/proposals/2), stating, “I propose we collectively find a way to achieve a token swap so we can unify the Enigma Community. We already have a diverse set of people ready to build on enigma, participate in governance, stake, and run nodes from all around the world. I welcome everyone interested in this to further discuss how it can be achieved here.”

The initial proposal served as a signal to solicit community feedback regarding a token swap, and was posted to Secretnodes.org’s GitHub to solicit comments here: https://github.com/secretnodes/secretnodes.org/issues/13

As can be seen in the comment thread there is overwhelming support by the community for a 1:1 ENG to SCRT burn to mint ratio. The scope of this proposal is not to get into arguments regarding token supply, or details surrounding future supply (i.e. inflation). Secretnodes.org believes decisions regarding future token supply are best left to later proposals when the network has more stability and active participation in governance. Furthermore, given the time sensitive nature of executing Burn ENG for SCRT! for the health of the network and community it’s best not to make the proposal terms herein any more complicated than they already are.
 
## Burn ENG for SCRT!

On March 7th 2020 Secretnodes org put out a high level plan for ["Burn ENG for SCRT!"](https://explorer.scrt.cashmaney.com/proposals/4) SCRT (“Secret”) is used for staking, governance, and transaction fees within the Enigma network which is now LIVE based on Cosmos SDK/Tendermint. It is critical to the future of the Enigma protocol that the broader community that currently holds ENG tokens to be able to burn their tokens in exchange for SCRT being minted to participate in staking, governance, and transaction fees. This proposal outlines a brief background, technical approach, and detailed milestones to achieving an expeditious, straightforward and secure Burn ENG for SCRT!

## Swap FAQ

## When is the Token Swap?

There is not a specific date yet for the token swap but the process is moving forward. As of 4/6/2020 the most up to date information on the swap plans can be found [here](https://explorer.scrt.cashmaney.com/proposals/4). More updates will come in the month of April 2020.

## Why will the Token Swap only be open for a limited window?

The token swap requires ongoing efforts / coordination to ensure it runs smoothly. For this reason it doesn't seem reasonble to expect it to continue forever, everyone is committed to running the swap for a reasonable amount of time so everyone is assured to get a minimum of 90 days to swap once the process officially starts.
