# Stake

The secretnodes.org community pool is administered by Secret Forerunners, inc [via secretnodes.org](https://t.me/secretnodes) which is run by the co-founders of secretnodes.org. We have privately raised a modest amount of funding to build a staking pool for a small handful of proof-of-stake networks, with a primary focus on enigma.

To stake into the secretnodes.org community pool, all you must do is [read and agree to our staking agreement](https://staking-terms.secretnodes.org/), then delegate to our Enigma Validator Address : `enigmavaloper1hjd20hjvkx06y8p42xl0uzr3gr3ue3nkm7wj8z`.
