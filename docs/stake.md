# Stake

The secretnodes.org community pool is administered by [OmniStake](https://t.me/omnistake) which is run by the co-founders of secretnodes.org. We have privately raised a modest amount of funding to build a staking pool for a small handful of proof-of-stake networks, with a primary focus on enigma. As long as we operate the community pool we are committed to continued investments into the org from fees generated.

To stake into the secretnodes.org pool, all you must do is [read and agree to our staking agreement](https://staking-terms.secretnodes.org/), then deposit ENG tokens into the deposit address ENS:[secretnodes.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/secretnodes.eth) non-ENS: `0x178Bbf2DC8c81Ca6111FCbA14451171f5C9D8EAF`.
