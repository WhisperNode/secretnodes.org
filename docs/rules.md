# Community Rules & Safety Tips

* No personal arguments, attacks, or trolling.
* No spamming, flooding, scamming, or fudding of the chat.
* No impersonating admins.
* Violation of any of the above will result in a warning and any messages that break the rules may be deleted. The need for subsequent warnings can result in an indefinite ban / restriction from the group at our discretion.

# Be Agreeable, Even When You Disagree
You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That's fine. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Please avoid:

* Name-calling
* Ad hominem attacks
* Responding to a post's tone instead of its actual content
* Knee-jerk contradiction
* Instead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation.

# Always Be Civil
Nothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:

* Be civil. Don't post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.
* Keep it clean. Don't post anything obscene or sexually explicit.
* Respect each other. Don’t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.
* Respect our forum. Don’t post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.
* These are not concrete terms with precise definitions - avoid even the appearance of any of these things. If you're unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of the New York Times.

This is a public telegram room. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.
