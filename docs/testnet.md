# Enigma Discovery Testnet Information
Last Updated : Date Nov 26, 2019

Currently we know that the upcoming Networked Testnet for enigma will happen on the Kovan testnet. We will update this when the date for test ENG distribution is known.

## Options to get Kovan Test ETH.
1. Request KETH by pasting the Ethereum address you anticipate receiving your testENG in this room [Kovan Testnet Faucet](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet)
2. Join us in [@secretnodes](https://t.me/secretnodes) and we'll send you some KETH for gas when the time comes, simply share an ETH address. Please wait till testENG is distributed to request from us!

```
Note
You must use a wallet that allows you to switch to the Kovan
testnet in order to use KETH or testENG.
Recommended wallets : Ledger, Trezor, metamask, mycrptoc.com.
