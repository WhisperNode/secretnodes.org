## About Secretnodes.org

Seceretnodes.org has deep roots in the crypto space. Secretnodes.org is a community-led group who cares about **privacy**, **security**, and **data rights**. We are dedicated to supporting secret node runners. Secretnodes.org founder, Ian Dixon, got involved with bitcoin in early 2011 and has been an avid node runner and researcher of Proof of Stake Protocols since their inception. [Brendan Kittredge](https://blog.enigma.co/meet-the-enigma-ambassadors-2-brendan-kittredge-2b3ebc0417c6) joined forces with Ian to provide business insight after much time spent supporting Enigma through the [Enigma Collective](https://blog.enigma.co/introducing-the-enigma-collective-3b5cefdda167). The core team compliments each other well and hopes to have contributions from many others that share their passion for privacy and belief in decentralized technologies as time moves on.
